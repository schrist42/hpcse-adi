	abstractNote={An alternating-direction implicit method for N-dimensional parabolic equations with mixed derivatives is considered. The method requires the solution of N tridiagonal matrix equations per time-step and combines computational simplicity with the possibility of unconditional stability for any N. The regimes of conditional stability for N ⩽ 6 show that the scheme is less effective for higher dimensional problems, owing to the proliferation of mixed derivatives. An alternative scheme (requiring 2 N tridiagonal operations) which involves a single iteration to time-centre the mixed derivatives is shown to improve accuracy and stability. In particular the iterative scheme allows second-order accuracy and unconditional stability in the important special cases of two and three space dimensions.},

 abstractNote={Numerical simulations of a simple reaction-diffusion model reveal a surprising variety of irregular spatiotemporal patterns. These patterns arise in response to finite-amplitude perturbations. Some of them resemble the steady irregular patterns recently observed in thin gel reactor experiments. Others consist of spots that grow until they reach a critical size, at which time they divide in two. If in some region the spots become overcrowded, all of the spots in that region decay into the uniform background.},
